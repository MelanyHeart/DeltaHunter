# DeltaHunter
DeltaHunter is an RPG server which can be self-hosted or modified to your hearts content. The server is primarily programmed using a plugin called Skript which features a very easy to understand programming language, as well as a couple other plugins for ease of development. 

Keep in mind, DeltaHunter is not in a playable state yet. When there is stable version which includes some neat foundational features, then I'll  begin publishing releases here on GitHub.

As for now, there is a set of tools in place for easier development of items and other basic things. The server is intended to be played in offline mode so there is a login/passkey system in place to keep admin accounts secure... (At least, in future because right now the /totalreset command can be used from an operator's account without needing to be logged in.)
